# Rotating Square — Learn JavaScript

Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see a rotating square (drawn using HTML Canvas) in the center of the page.

Quick start (from this project folder):

```bash
# option A: open directly (double-click or open in browser)
xdg-open index.html

# option B: run a simple local server and visit http://localhost:8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Guess the Green Square

Open `index.html` in a browser to run a simple, non-interactive guessing game.

How it works:
- Five red squares are shown in a row.
- After 5 seconds one random square turns green for 5 seconds.
- The square returns to red and the cycle repeats indefinitely.

Quick start (from this project folder):

```bash
# open directly
xdg-open index.html

# or run a simple server and visit http://localhost:8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Teaching ideas:
- Ask your kids to predict which square will turn green next.
- Change the timings in `script.js` (the two `5000` values) to make the game faster or slower.
- Modify the colors in `style.css` to experiment with design.
